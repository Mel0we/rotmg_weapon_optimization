# rotmg_weapon_optimization
Data analysis project to emulate different portions of the damage formula in Realm of the Mad God

Project utilizes web scraping from rvest to get game info
Run class_page, dagger_page, and boss_page (optional for now)
Then utilize dps_charts
dps_charts are still in progress, currently only displays
one weapon at a time, more in the future
